You can put img in static folder generated by vue cli. Files in static will not be processed by webpack. 
All files in src/assets will be treated like source code. 

Any file placed in static/ should be referenced using the absolute URL /static/[filename]. If you change assetSubDirectory to assets, then these URLs will need to be changed to /assets/[filename].
