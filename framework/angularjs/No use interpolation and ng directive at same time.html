Don't use:

<div style="color: {{ 'orange' }}; font-weight: {{ 'bold' }};" ngStyle="styleString">
	no good	
</div>

don't use {{value}} and ngStyle at same time. 

Note: Angular directive attributes take either expressions or interpolation markup with embedded expressions. 
It is considered bad practice to embed interpolation markup inside an expression:
<!-- bad -->
<div ng-show="form{{$index}}.$invalid"></div>

<!-- good -->
<div ng-show="getForm($index).$invalid"></div>


<script type="text/javascript">
	function getForm(index) {
	  return $scope['form' + index];
	}
</script>
You can also access the scope with this in your templates:
<div ng-show="this['form' + $index].$invalid"></div>


<h1>Why mixing interpolation and expressions is bad practice:</h1>

- It increases the complexity of the markup
- There is no guarantee that it works for every directive, because interpolation 
  itself is a directive. If another directive accesses attribute data before interpolation has run, 
  it will get the raw interpolation markup and not data.
- It impacts performance, as interpolation adds another watcher to the scope.
- Since this is not recommended usage, we do not test for this, and changes to Angular core may break your code.
