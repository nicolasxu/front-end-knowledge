1. Right click on the element of interest in your browser and select 'inspect element'. You should see the browser debugger with the element you clicked on highlighted.

2. The debugger allows you to access the currently selected element in the console as $0 variable.

3. To retrieve the associated scope in console execute: angular.element($0).scope() or just type $scope
