 boolean attributes: 
 disabled, required, selected, checked, readOnly , and open

 <div>
 	note 1:
 	Their presence as attribute in HTML tag means true, their absence means false.
 </div>

 <div>
	note 1:
	Their value is ignored by browser, e.g. 
		<button disabled="fdsafdsaf">Button</button>
		The value of disabled attribute is ignored by browser according W3C standard.
 </div>

	<div>
		For all the boolean attribute, there is ng- directive for them. Intepolation won't work, because
		if attribute is present, the value is always true. 
	</div>
