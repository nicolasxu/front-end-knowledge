<h1>Each provide access to a $delegate, which is the instantiated service/directive/filter you want to decorate

</h1>


<script type="text/javascript">
	ngular.module('myApp', [])

	.config([ '$provide', function($provide) {

	  $provide.decorator('$log', [
	    '$delegate',
	    function $logDecorator($delegate) {

	      var originalWarn = $delegate.warn;
	      $delegate.warn = function decoratedWarn(msg) {
	        msg = 'Decorated Warn: ' + msg;
	        originalWarn.apply($delegate, arguments);
	      };

	      return $delegate;
	    }
	  ]);
	}]);
</script>

After the $log service has been instantiated the decorator is fired. The decorator function has a $delegate object injected to provide access to the service that matches the selector in the decorator. This $delegate will be the service you are decorating. The return value of the function provided to the decorator will take place of the service, directive, or filter being decorated.
