Value Recipe
Let's say that we want to have a very simple service called "clientId" that provides a string representing an authentication id used for some remote API. You would define it like this:
<script>
	var myApp = angular.module('myApp', []);
	myApp.value('clientId', 'a12345654321x');
</script>
Notice how we created an Angular module called myApp, and specified that this module definition contains a "recipe" for constructing the clientId service, which is a simple string in this case.

And this is how you would display it via Angular's data-binding:
<script>
	myApp.controller('DemoController', ['clientId', function DemoController(clientId) {
	  this.clientId = clientId;
	}]);
</script>
<html ng-app="myApp">
  <body ng-controller="DemoController as demo">
    Client ID: {{demo.clientId}}
  </body>
</html>
In this example, we've used the Value recipe to define the value to provide when DemoController asks for the service with id "clientId".
