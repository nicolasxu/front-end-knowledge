Factory Recipe
The Value recipe is very simple to write, but lacks some important features we often need when creating services. 
Let's now look at the Value recipe's more powerful sibling, the Factory. The Factory recipe adds the following abilities:

- ability to use other services (have dependencies)
- service initialization
- delayed/lazy initialization
The Factory recipe constructs a new service using a function with zero or more arguments (these are dependencies on other services). The return value of this function is the service instance created by this recipe.

Note: All services in Angular are singletons. That means that the injector uses each recipe at most once to create the object. The injector then caches the reference for all future needs.

Since a Factory is a more powerful version of the Value recipe, the same service can be constructed with it. Using our previous clientId Value recipe example, we can rewrite it as a Factory recipe like this:
<script>
	myApp.factory('clientId', function clientIdFactory() {
	  return 'a12345654321x';
	});
</script>
But given that the token is just a string literal, sticking with the Value recipe is still more appropriate as it makes the code easier to follow.

Let's say, however, that we would also like to create a service that computes a token used for authentication against a remote API. This token will be called apiToken and will be computed based on the clientId value and a secret stored in the browser's local storage:
<script>
	myApp.factory('apiToken', ['clientId', function apiTokenFactory(clientId) {
	  var encrypt = function(data1, data2) {
	    // NSA-proof encryption algorithm:
	    return (data1 + ':' + data2).toUpperCase();
	  };

	  var secret = window.localStorage.getItem('myApp.secret');
	  var apiToken = encrypt(clientId, secret);

	  return apiToken;
	}]);
</script>
In the code above, we see how the apiToken service is defined via the Factory recipe that depends on the clientId service. The factory service then uses NSA-proof encryption to produce an authentication token.

Best Practice: name the factory functions as <serviceId>Factory (e.g., apiTokenFactory). While this naming convention is not required, it helps when navigating the codebase or looking at stack traces in the debugger.
Just like with the Value recipe, the Factory recipe can create a service of any type, whether it be a primitive, object literal, function, or even an instance of a custom type.
