One-way in
People often describe property binding as one-way data binding because it flows a value in one direction, from a componentâ€™s data property into a target element property.

We cannot use property binding to pull values out of the target element. We can't bind to a property of the target element to read it. We can only set it.




<h1>[class.selected]="hero === selectedHero"</h1>
<p>Notice in the template that the class.selected is surrounded in square brackets ([]). This is the syntax for a property binding, a binding in which data flows one way from the data source (the expression hero === selectedHero) to a property of class.
