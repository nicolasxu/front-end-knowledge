Template statements

A template statement responds to an event raised by a binding target such as an element, component, or directive.

(event)="statement"

A template statement will change application status, otherwise there is no point responding to a event. 

--- statement context
	Template statements cannot refer to anything in the global namespace. They can’t refer to window or document. They can’t call console.log or Math.max.
	The onSave in (click)="onSave()" is sure to be a method of the data-bound component instance.

avoid writing complex template statements
