<hero-detail [hero]="currentHero" (deleteRequest)="deleteHero($event)">
</hero-detail>

<script type="text/javascript">
	// Target properties must be explicitly marked as inputs or outputs.
	@Input()  hero: Hero;
	@Output() deleteRequest = new EventEmitter<Hero>();
</script>



<script type="text/javascript">
	Alternatively, we can identify members in the inputs and outputs arrays of the directive metadata, as in this example:
	@Component({
	  inputs: ['hero'],
	  outputs: ['deleteRequest'],
	})
	export class appComponent {
		hero: Hero;
		deleteRequest:EventEmitter<Hero> = new EventEmitter<Hero>();
	}

</script>

We can specify an input/output property either with a decorator or in a metadata array. Don't do both!


Input properties usually receive data values. Output properties expose event producers, such as EventEmitter objects.

HeroDetailComponent.hero is an input property from the perspective of HeroDetailComponent because data flows into that property from a template binding expression.

HeroDetailComponent.deleteRequest is an output property from the perspective of HeroDetailComponent because events stream out of that property and toward the handler in a template binding statement.
