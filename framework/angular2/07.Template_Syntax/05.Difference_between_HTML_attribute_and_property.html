Attributes are defined by HTML. Properties are defined by the DOM (Document Object Model).

	- A few HTML attributes have 1:1 mapping to properties. id is one example.
	- Some HTML attributes don't have corresponding properties. colspan is one example.
	- Some DOM properties don't have corresponding attributes. textContent is one example.
	- Many HTML attributes appear to map to properties ... but not in the way we might think!



Attributes initialize DOM properties and then they are done. Property values can change; attribute values can't.

For example, when the browser renders <input type="text" value="Bob">, it creates a corresponding DOM node with a value property initialized to "Bob".
When the user enters "Sally" into the input box, the DOM element value property becomes "Sally". But the HTML value attribute remains unchanged as we discover if we ask the input element about that attribute: input.getAttribute('value') // returns "Bob"



Template binding works with properties and events, property in directive and component, not attributes.
