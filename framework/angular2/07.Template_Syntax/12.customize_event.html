<!-- HeroDetailComponent.ts (template) -->
template: `
<div>
  <img src="{{heroImageUrl}}">
  <span [style.text-decoration]="lineThrough">
    {{prefix}} {{hero?.fullName}}
  </span>
  <button (click)="delete()">Delete</button>
</div>`


<script type="text/javascript">
	
	// This component make a request but it can't actually delete a hero.
	deleteRequest = new EventEmitter<Hero>();

	delete() {
	  this.deleteRequest.emit(this.hero);
	}

</script>


a hosting parent component that binds to the HeroDetailComponent's deleteRequest event.
<hero-detail (deleteRequest)="deleteHero($event)" [hero]="currentHero"></hero-detail>
When the deleteRequest event fires, Angular calls the parent component's deleteHero method, passing the hero-to-delete (emitted by HeroDetail) in the $event variable.
