<form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(theForm)" #theForm="ngForm">
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="name">Name</label>
    <input class="form-control" name="name" required [(ngModel)]="currentHero.firstName">
  </div>
  <button type="submit" [disabled]="!theForm.form.valid">Submit</button>
</form>


What is the value of theForm?

It would be the HTMLFormElement if Angular hadn't taken it over. It's actually ngForm, a reference to the Angular built-in NgForm directive that wraps the native HTMLFormElement and endows it with additional superpowers such as the ability to track the validity of user input.
