We bind to NgSwitch when we want to display one element tree (an element and its children) from a set of possible element trees, based on some condition. Angular puts only the selected element tree into the DOM.



<span [ngSwitch]="toeChoice">
  <span *ngSwitchCase="'Eenie'">Eenie</span>
  <span *ngSwitchCase="'Meanie'">Meanie</span>
  <span *ngSwitchCase="'Miney'">Miney</span>
  <span *ngSwitchCase="'Moe'">Moe</span>
  <span *ngSwitchDefault>other</span>
</span>


We bind the parent NgSwitch directive to an expression returning a switch value. The value is a string in this example, but it can be a value of any type.

Do not put the asterisk (*) in front of ngSwitch. Use the property binding instead.

Do put the asterisk (*) in front of ngSwitchCase and ngSwitchDefault.
