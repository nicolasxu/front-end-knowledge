<h3>
    We can limit the scope of an injected service to a branch of 
    the application hierarchy by providing that service at the 
    sub-root component for that branch. 
</h3>

<!-- example -->
<script>
    @Component({
        selector: 'unsorted-heroes',
        template: `<div *ngFor="let hero of heroes">{{hero.name}}</div>`,
        providers: [HeroService]
    })
    export class HeroesBaseComponent implements OnInit {
        constructor(private heroService: HeroService) { }
    }    
</script>

<h1>IMPORTANT:
  We could also provide the HeroService to a 
  different component elsewhere in the application. 
  That would result in a different instance of the 
  service, living in a different injector.  

</h1>
<h1>So, the abstracted rule is 
  - Same subtree, same service instance, and only one of this service instance.
  - Different subtree, different instance of the same service will be created.
