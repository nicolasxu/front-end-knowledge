There's another way to get the user data without the $event variable.

<!-- app/loop-back.component.ts -->
<script type="text/javascript">
	@Component({
	  selector: 'loop-back',
	  template: `
	    <input #box (keyup)="0">
	    <p>{{box.value}}</p>
	  `
	})
	export class LoopbackComponent { }
</script>

<h1>Why bind the keyup event to a statement "0"? </h1>

Angular only updates the bindings (and therefore the screen) if we do something in response to asynchronous events such as keystrokes.

That's why we bind the keyup event to a statement that does ... well, nothing. We're binding to the number 0, the shortest statement we can think of. That is all it takes to keep Angular happy. 


That template reference variable is clearly easier to get to the textbox with that variable than to go through the $event object. 

Using template reference variable to avoid the $event structure. 
<!-- app/keyup.components.ts (v2) -->
<script type="text/javascript">
	@Component({
	  selector: 'key-up2',
	  template: `
	    <input #box (keyup)="onKey(box.value)">
	    <p>{{values}}</p>
	  `
	})
	export class KeyUpComponent_v2 {
	  values = '';
	  onKey(value: string) {
	    this.values += value + ' | ';
	  }
	}
</script>



<!-- phone refers to the input element; pass its `value` to an event handler -->
<input #phone placeholder="phone number">
<button (click)="callPhone(phone.value)">Call</button>

<!-- fax refers to the input element; pass its `value` to an event handler -->
<input ref-fax placeholder="fax number">
<button (click)="callFax(fax.value)">Fax</button>
