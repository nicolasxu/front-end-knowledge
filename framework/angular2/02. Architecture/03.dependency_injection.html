Dependency injection is a way to supply a new instance of a class with the fully-formed dependencies it requires. 

An injector maintains a container of service instances that it has previously created. If a requested service instance is not in the container, the injector makes one and adds it to the container before returning the service to Angular.

You can register providers in 
	- modules or in 
	- components.

************* Register at module level ********************
In general, add providers to the root module so that the same instance of a service is available everywhere.
	app/app.module.ts (module providers)

<script>
	providers: [
  BackendService,
  HeroService,
  Logger
]
</script>


*************** Register at component level ****************
Alternatively, register at a component level in the providers property of the @Component metadata:

@Component({
  moduleId: module.id,
  selector:    'hero-list',
  templateUrl: 'hero-list.component.html',
  providers:  [ HeroService ]
})
Registering at a component level means you get a new instance of the service with each new instance of that component.
