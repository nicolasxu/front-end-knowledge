<script>
	

	var MyItemView = Marionette.ItemView.extend({
	  onRender: function(){
	    // manipulate the `el` here. it's already
	    // been rendered, and is full of the view's
	    // HTML, ready to go.
	  }
	});
</script>


onRender is called when this view is rendered, BUT it is not attached to the DOM
so if you use 
<script>
	$("#my-button")
</script>
you will get nothing

If you want to manipulate rendered cotnent, the correct way is use jquery content:
<script>
	$("#my-button", this.$el).addClass('primary');
</script>
