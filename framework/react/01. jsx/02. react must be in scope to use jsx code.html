Since JSX compiles into calls to React.createElement, 
the React library must also always be in scope from your JSX code.

<script>
  
  import React from 'react';
  import CustomButton from './CustomButton';

  function WarningButton() {
    // return React.createElement(CustomButton, {color: 'red'}, null);
    return <CustomButton color="red" />;
  }


</script>
