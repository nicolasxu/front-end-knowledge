/*
An object is deemed iterable if it has an implementation for the 
Symbol.iterator property. Some built-in types like Array, Map, Set, 
String, Int32Array, Uint32Array, etc. have their Symbol.iterator 
property already implemented. Symbol.iterator function on an object 
is responsible for returning the list of values to iterate on.
