// definition of structural type system 

/* 


	The basic rule for TypeScriptâ€™s structural type system is that 
	x is compatible with y if y has at least the same members as x.

*/

// example:


interface Named {
    name: string;
}

let x: Named;
// y's inferred type is { name: string; location: string; }
let y = { name: "Alice", location: "Seattle" };
x = y; // assignment is allowed because y also has all the properties that x has
