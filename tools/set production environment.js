/*

Before running your app, you can do this in console,

export NODE_ENV=production
Or if you are in windows you could try this:

SET NODE_ENV=production
or you can run your app like this:

NODE_ENV=production node app.js
You can also set it in your js file:

process.env.NODE_ENV = 'production';
But I don't suggest to do it in your runtime file, 
since it's not easy to open up VIM in your server 
and change it to production. You can make a 
config.json file in your directory and everytime 
your app runs, it reads from it and sets 
the configuration.
