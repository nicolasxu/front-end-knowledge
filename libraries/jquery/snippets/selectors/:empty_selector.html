Description: Select all elements that have no children (including text nodes).

This is the inverse of :parent.

The W3C recommends that the <p> element have at least one child node, even if that child is merely text. 


Some other elements, on the other hand, are empty (i.e. have no children) by definition: <input>, <img>, <br>, and <hr>, for example.
