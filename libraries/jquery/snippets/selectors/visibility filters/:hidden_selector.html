Description: Selects all elements that are hidden.

Elements can be considered hidden for several reasons:
- They have a CSS display value of none.
- They are form elements with type="hidden".
- Their width and height are explicitly set to 0.
- An ancestor element is hidden, so the element is not shown on the page.

Because :hidden is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification

For :hidden, an element is assumed to be hidden if it or any of its parents 
consumes no space in the document. 
- display: none consumes no space
- script tag consumes no space
- During animations that hide an element, the element is considered to be visible until the end of the animation.
but visbility: hidden will take space, and
width: 0 also takes space. 

So element with 
visibility:hidden will not be selected by $(':hidden')

note:
<script>
	$( elem ).css( "visibility", "hidden" ).is( ":hidden" ) == false);
</script>

normally it is used:
<script>
	$('div:hidden').show();
</script>

if you use 
<script>
	var sel = $(':hidden');
</script>
the sel will include <script>, <head>... tags.
So make sure you put a selector before :hidden.
