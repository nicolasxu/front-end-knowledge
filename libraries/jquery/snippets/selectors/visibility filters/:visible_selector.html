So, every element selected by :visible isn't selected by :hidden and vice versa.

All option elements are considered hidden, regardless of their selected state.

During animations that hide an element, the element is considered visible until the end of the animation. 
During animations to show an element, the element is considered visible at the start at the animation.

	});
