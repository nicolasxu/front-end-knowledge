<h1>
  Since @extend works by adding a selector to another selector without duplicating any of the properties it's actually impossible to join selectors in different @media blocks.
</h1>

<h1>
  It does work the other way though. Any media queries surrounding the placeholder selector will be applied to the selectors extending it providing they are not in an @media block:
</h1>


<style type="text/css">
  
@media screen {
  %icon {
    transition: background-color ease .2s;
    margin: 0 .5em;
  }
}

.error-icon {
  @extend %icon;
}

.info-icon {
  @extend %icon;
}


</style>


This will compile to:

<style type="text/css">

@media screen {
  .error-icon, .info-icon {
    transition: background-color ease .2s;
    margin: 0 .5em;
  }
}
  


</style>
