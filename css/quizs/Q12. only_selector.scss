var question = "What is the use of the only selector?";

	@media only screen and (max-width: 1024px) {
	  margin: 0;
	}





/*
	Stops older browsers from parsing the remainder of the selector
	Apply the style for screen only and ignore the device max-width
	It does nothing
	Skip
*/

// answer: Stops older browsers from parsing the remainder of the selector
