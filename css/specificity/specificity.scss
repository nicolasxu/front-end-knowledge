Specificity hierarchy Link
	Every selector has its place in the specificity hierarchy. 
	There are four distinct categories which define the specificity level of a given selector:
	1. Inline styles (Presence of style in document).
	An inline style lives within your XHTML document. It is attached directly to the element to be styled. E.g. <h1 style="color: #fff;">
	2. IDs (# of ID selectors)
	ID is an identifier for your page elements, such as #div.
	3. Classes, attributes and pseudo-classes (# of class selectors).
	This group includes .classes, [attributes] and pseudo-classes such as :hover, :focus etc.
	4. Elements and pseudo-elements (# of Element (type) selectors).
	Including for instance :before and :after.

How to measure specificity? Link
	Memorize how to measure specificity. 
	“Start at 0, 
	add 1000 for style attribute, 
	add 100 for each ID, 
	add 10 for each attribute, class or pseudo-class, 
	add 1 for each element name or pseudo-element. So in
	body #content .data img:hover
	the specificity value would be 122 (0,1,2,2 or 0122): 
	100 for #content, 10 for .data, 10 for :hover, 1 for body and 1 for img.” [CSS Specificity]
